The optional _source_ argument takes a string indicating the source value to use by default (normally `\"view\"`). The optional _marks_ argument takes an object whose keys will be treated as the legal mark types, so long as the corresponding values are truthy. For more, see the [Vega Event Stream documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/event-streams).\n",
